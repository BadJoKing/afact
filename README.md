# afact
Calculates the original number from any given factorial

## Installation
Just put the executable in some folder you like and add that folder to the Environment Variables and boom: You got yourself some command line factorial reversal.

### Alternatively...
...put the .py file in some folder, open a powershell/cmd window in that folder and type:
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile install afact.py
```
After some time there should be a dist folder in said directory where the executable should have appeared.

### Requirements
Yeah, if you're running the released executable, you pretty much only need Windows.
For the manual build instead you gotta have python installed.
